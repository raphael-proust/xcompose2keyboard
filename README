xcompose2keyboard converts .XCompose files for X11 input into a keyboard
file for plan9.

#Reasons

When using acme(1), the multi-key combinations are not the same as with X11 applications. This is suboptimal. Hence this project.

#Compilation

`ocamlfind ocamlopt -package uutf -o xcompose2keyboard xcompose2keyboard.ml`

#Usage
	xcompose2keyboard <$HOME/.XCompose >keyboard
